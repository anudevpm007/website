Once we have the addresses, we\u02bcll create a simple Lua script to automate value manipulation. By the end of this guide, you\u02bcll understand how to modify in-game values like health and ammo, giving you the ability to customize your gaming experience as you wish.

The bug exists in the ping functionality within the device’s diagnostic features. This type of command injection is common in cheap IoT devices and relatively easy to find. After identifying the vulnerability, we extracted the firmware from the device’s SPI flash for further analysis. The hardware hacking aspects of the device will be covered in Part 2 of this article."},

After an #snprintf operation, the buffer named final_buffer is passed to va_cmd (a wrapper for execve) without any sanitization. Since #final_buffer contains the input we given via the diagnostics page, and #va_cmd executes it directly, this leads to command injection."},

A single vulnerability can lead to catastrophic data breaches, legal liabilities, and reputational damage. Enter fuzzing: an innovative and highly effective technique that has become a cornerstone of modern software security testing."},
        {"p":"Imagine your software as a fortress, responsible for safeguarding sensitive data and critical business operations. Fuzzing acts as a relentless security sentry, continuously probing the walls of this fortress, searching for weaknesses before cyber attackers can exploit them. Fuzzing ensures no stone is left unturned in the pursuit of security and reliability."},
        {"h2":"What is Fuzzing?"},
        {"p":"Fuzzing, also known as fuzz testing, is an automated software testing technique that involves injecting unexpected, malformed, or random inputs into a program to detect vulnerabilities. The goal is to uncover bugs that might cause crashes, memory corruption, or unexpected behavior—issues that could otherwise lead to severe security exploits.\n The technique is particularly powerful for compiled languages like C and C++, which are prone to memory-related vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, null pointer dereferences, and use-after-free errors. However, fuzzing isn’t limited to these languages; it is widely applied to various domains, including:"},
